# Causal-LLM-Framework-for-Graph-Discovery

A comprehensive framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in causal discovery tasks, combining domain knowledge utilization with data-driven approaches to uncover causal relationships in complex systems.

## Overview

This framework explores whether Large Language Models can uncover causal relationships by leveraging embedded domain knowledge and identifying statistical patterns. The project integrates two key strategies:

1. **Domain Knowledge Approach**: Using LLMs' embedded knowledge through prompt-based full-graph discovery
2. **Data-Driven Approach**: Employing multivariate statistical dependency modeling (causal_llm)

The framework rigorously evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in causal discovery, comparing them against traditional data-driven algorithms across various scenarios.
